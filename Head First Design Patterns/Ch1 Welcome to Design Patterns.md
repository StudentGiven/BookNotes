Walk through a simple SimUDuck App to see how one pattern works

Problem: 
When adding new behavior to the super class, also adding behavior that was not appropriate for some subclass.

Thinking: 
A great use of inheritence for the purpose of reuse hasn't turned out so well when it comes to maintenance.

Why do we need design pattern: 
Build software in a way so that when we need to change it, we could do so with the least possible impact on the existing code. Could spend less time reworking code.

Design Principal:
Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.
In other words:
Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t.
